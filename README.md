# SettleX — Split Bills. Pay On-Chain.

> A decentralised expense-splitting app built on the **Stellar Network**. Add group expenses, split them by any method, and pay each member's share directly from your Freighter wallet — all settled on-chain in under 5 seconds.

## Project Description

SettleX solves a common problem: splitting group expenses fairly and actually collecting the money. Traditional apps (Splitwise, etc.) only track IOUs — you still have to chase people for cash. SettleX closes the loop by letting every participant pay their exact share directly via the **Stellar blockchain** in a single click.

Key differentiators:

- **No intermediary** — money moves peer-to-peer between Stellar wallets.
- **On-chain receipts** — every payment produces a real transaction hash traceable on any Stellar explorer.
- **QR code payments** — generates a SEP-0007 payment URI so anyone with a Stellar wallet can pay by scanning.
- **Trip mode** — group multiple expenses under a trip, track net balances, and settle the whole trip with one flow.
- **Non-custodial** — your private key never leaves your Freighter wallet extension; SettleX only receives the signed transaction envelope.

## How It Works

```
User adds expense
       ↓
Defines members + split mode (equal / percent / weight)
       ↓
SDK builds a Stellar Payment operation
  • from:   payer's public key
  • to:     payee's Stellar address
  • amount: share amount in XLM
  • memo:   expense ID
       ↓
Freighter signs the transaction client-side
(private key never leaves the browser extension)
       ↓
Signed envelope submitted to Horizon REST API
       ↓
Stellar validators confirm → finalised in ~5s
       ↓
tx hash stored → share marked "paid" in app
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later
- **npm** v9 or later
- **Freighter Wallet** browser extension → [freighter.app](https://freighter.app)
  - Switch Freighter to **Testnet** in Settings → Network
- A funded Stellar **Testnet** account — get free XLM at [friendbot](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/friendbot?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/settlex.git
cd settlex
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` — see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Stellar Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> All variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because they are read client-side. No secret keys are stored — the app is fully non-custodial.

## Blockchain Integration

SettleX uses **Stellar's native payment protocol** — no smart contracts are required because peer-to-peer XLM transfers are a first-class primitive on the Stellar ledger.

### Payment flow (code path)

1. **`lib/stellar/buildTransaction.ts`**
   - Loads the payer's account sequence number from Horizon
   - Constructs a `TransactionBuilder` with a `Payment` operation
   - Attaches a `Memo.text(expenseId)` so the payment is traceable
   - Returns a serialised XDR transaction envelope

2. **`@stellar/freighter-api` — `signTransaction()`**
   - Sends the XDR to the Freighter extension for signing
   - User approves in the popup — private key never exposed to the app

3. **`lib/stellar/submitTransaction.ts`**
   - POSTs the signed XDR to `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/transactions`
   - Returns the `hash` of the confirmed transaction

4. **`hooks/usePayment.ts`**
   - Orchestrates steps 1–3
   - On success: calls `updateShare(expenseId, memberId, { paid: true, txHash })`
   - The `txHash` is shown to the user and links to [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet)

### Why no smart contract?

Stellar's protocol natively supports trustless, atomic XLM transfers. Each `Payment` operation is:

- **Atomic** — it either fully succeeds or fully fails
- **Transparent** — publicly verifiable on any Stellar block explorer
- **Final** — confirmed within ~5 seconds, no rollback possible
- **Auditable** — the memo field ties every on-chain payment back to a specific expense

## Testnet Notes

- This app runs entirely on **Stellar Testnet** — no real funds are used.
- Fund your Freighter testnet account via Stellar Friendbot:
  ```
  https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/friendbot?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
  ```
- All transactions are visible at [stellar.expert/explorer/testnet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet).
