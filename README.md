## Project Description

SettleX solves a fundamental problem with group expense sharing: apps like Splitwise only track IOUs — you still have to chase people for real money. SettleX closes the loop by connecting split calculations directly to on-chain payments.

Every payment produces a **real, verifiable transaction hash** on the Stellar blockchain. An on-chain Soroban smart contract acts as an immutable settlement ledger, so payment records cannot be edited or disputed. The app syncs across all participants in real time — when someone pays, everyone sees it immediately.

**Core design principles:**

- **Non-custodial** — your private key never leaves your wallet extension. SettleX only receives the signed transaction envelope.
- **No intermediary** — money moves peer-to-peer between Stellar wallets; the app never holds funds.
- **On-chain receipts** — every settled share has a Stellar transaction hash you can verify on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet).
- **Multi-wallet** — supports Freighter, xBull, and Lobstr via a custom `StellarWalletsKit` with install detection.

## How It Works

```
User connects wallet (Freighter / xBull / Lobstr)
              |
User creates expense, adds members, picks split mode
              |
App calculates each member's exact share
              |
Payer clicks "Pay XLM"
              |
    +---------+-----------+
    |                     |
buildTransaction()    checkIsPaid()     <- on-chain duplicate check (Soroban)
    |
TransactionBuilder constructs Payment operation
  · from:   payer public key
  · to:     payee Stellar address
  · amount: share amount in XLM
  · memo:   expense ID
    |
Wallet extension signs client-side
(private key never leaves the browser)
    |
Signed envelope submitted to Horizon REST API
    |
Stellar validators confirm in ~5 seconds
    |
recordPaymentOnChain() stores to Soroban contract:
  trip_id, expense_id, payer, member, amount, tx_hash
    |
tx hash stored in app, share marked "paid"
useContractEvents polls every 10s -> syncs state for all participants
```

## Smart Contract

SettleX deploys a **Soroban smart contract** on Stellar Testnet as an immutable, tamper-proof ledger of all settled payments.

### Deployed Contract

| Field       | Value                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract ID | `CDYWC4JQBCARETZ5VKDJNNY3H37WX3CRUG764NBI7JGU37MYQCKMRU74`                                                                             |
| Network     | Stellar Testnet                                                                                                                        |
| Language    | Rust (`soroban-sdk` v21.7.6)                                                                                                           |
| Explorer    | [stellar.expert → contract](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CDYWC4JQBCARETZ5VKDJNNY3H37WX3CRUG764NBI7JGU37MYQCKMRU74) |

### Verified Contract Call Transaction

**Transaction hash:** `588b55a12910227e3d7aa849f70efebde6ab2f0ca75e95389a67e33f9dd930ff`

[View on Stellar Explorer](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/588b55a12910227e3d7aa849f70efebde6ab2f0ca75e95389a67e33f9dd930ff)

This transaction is a live, verifiable `record_payment` call to the deployed contract on Stellar Testnet.

### Contract Functions

| Function                                                              | Type  | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `record_payment(trip_id, expense_id, payer, member, amount, tx_hash)` | Write | Stores payment record on-chain after XLM transfer       |
| `get_payments(trip_id)`                                               | Read  | Returns all payment records for a trip                  |
| `is_paid(expense_id, member)`                                         | Read  | Checks if a member has already settled a specific share |

**Error codes handled by the frontend:**

| Code | Name            | Meaning                                  |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| #1   | `InvalidAmount` | Payment amount is zero or negative       |
| #2   | `AlreadyPaid`   | This share was already settled on-chain  |
| #3   | `EmptyId`       | Trip ID or expense ID is an empty string |

### Why a Smart Contract?

In a Horizon-only setup there is no shared source of truth for payment status — any user could mark a share as paid without actually transferring XLM. The Soroban contract solves this:

- `record_payment` stores the real Stellar `tx_hash` as proof of transfer.
- `is_paid` acts as a duplicate guard — re-settling an already-paid share is rejected on-chain with `AlreadyPaid (#2)`.
- All records are permanently on the Stellar ledger and cannot be modified or deleted by anyone, including the app operator.

### Real-Time Events

The contract emits a `pmt_rec` event for every confirmed payment. `hooks/useContractEvents.ts` polls the Soroban RPC every 10 seconds and on browser tab focus. New events are deduplicated by `txHash` and merged into React state — all participants see confirmed payments without refreshing the page.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later
- **npm** v9 or later
- **Freighter Wallet** browser extension — [freighter.app](https://freighter.app)
  - In Freighter: Settings → Network → select **Testnet**
- A funded Stellar Testnet account — get free XLM from [Stellar Friendbot](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/friendbot?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soumen0818/SettleX.git
cd SettleX
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a Supabase project

SettleX uses Supabase for real-time cross-user sync. Without it, data only persists locally in the current browser session.

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL Editor, run the full schema from [`supabase-setup.sql`](supabase-setup.sql) (or follow [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for a walkthrough).
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon key** from Project Settings → API.

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in your Supabase credentials. The contract ID and RPC URL are pre-filled with the deployed testnet values. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full reference.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your Freighter wallet (set to Testnet).

### 6. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create (or edit) `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
# Stellar Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=TESTNET
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_EXPLORER=https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet

# Soroban Smart Contract (deployed — no changes needed)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=CDYWC4JQBCARETZ5VKDJNNY3H37WX3CRUG764NBI7JGU37MYQCKMRU74

# Supabase (from Project Settings → API in your Supabase dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=SettleX
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

> All variables carry the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix because they are read client-side. The Supabase anon key is safe to expose — access is governed by Row Level Security (RLS) policies in your database.

---

## Testing

### JavaScript / TypeScript unit tests

```bash
npm test
```

For coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__tests__/split/calculator.test.ts`      | Equal split, custom/weighted split, amount validation, Stellar address format checks         |
| `__tests__/settlement/netBalance.test.ts` | Net-balance algorithm: simple debt, netting, three-person chains, wallet address passthrough |
| `__tests__/utils/formatters.test.ts`      | `formatAddress`, `formatXLM`, `stroopsToXlm` conversions                                     |

**45 tests across 3 suites — all passing.** See the test output screenshot in [Screenshots](#screenshots).

### Rust contract tests

```bash
cd contract
cargo test
```

8 tests: `record_and_query`, `multiple_members`, `multiple_expenses_same_trip`, `duplicate_payment_rejected`, `zero_amount_rejected`, `negative_amount_rejected`, `is_paid_unknown_returns_false`, `get_payments_unknown_trip_is_empty`.
